Description of my hash function:

    It uses a string and creates its KEY integer
value based on the characters' individual ASCII 
codes. Each ASCII value is cubed in my case. The 
KEY is then modulussed by the tablesize. This is
value that is used to place and find a word in the 
hash table.

Print of Getty.txt:

1 Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this  
2 continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
3 proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a 
4 great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so 
5 conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met here on a 
6 great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of 
7 it as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that  
8 that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we 
9 should do this. But in a larger sense we can not dedicate - we can not 
10 consecrate - we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and  
11 dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power 
12 to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what 
13 we say here, but can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the  
14 living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they 
15 have, thus far, so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be here 
16 dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored 
17 dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave 
18 the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that  
19 these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation shall have a 
20 new birth of freedom; and that this government of the people, by the 
21 people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
